[Toaster](http://learntoaster.com) is a project I am working on for people to increase their knowledge on certain subjects but don't really know where to start.
It increases your general development and teaches you really basic to pretty advanced stuff on just about any subject. It is not about funny obscure facts but it is about learning about things that you think **"I should've known that but I didn't."**

Being able to name all the planets in our solar system is something people would find 'general knowledge' but I bet there are enough people out there that would get to only 5 or 6. 
And even if not, there will probably come a moment in your life where it's useful to know all the letters in the NATO alphabet (alpha, beta, gamma, etc.) or how to say 'Thank you' in Finnish.

It's not about learning a language, it's not about getting better at math, it's not about learning geography, it's about **getting you started to do all of that**!
